# Youtube-Audio-Downloader-Without-UI
This is the version without UI, everything works from the console, when executing the program
For it to work correctly, you need to have the "pytube" library
The program is in Spanish, but the order to use is:
1) Enter the url of the youtube video
2) Enter the location where you want to save the file. (enter the location + the name of the file with the .mp3
3) Wait a bit, and voila!

If you want an easier to use version, in my repositories there is one with a graphical interface!
